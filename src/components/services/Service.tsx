      At Modern Nature Design Nepal, we know that perfection begins with the smallest detail. That’s why we offer strike-offs and samples — your opportunity to experience the true color, texture, and craftsmanship of your rug before full production.<br /><br />
      Our strike-offs showcase every element — yarn quality, pile height, and weaving precision — so you can confidently finalize your design. Available in <strong>30×30 cm</strong>, <strong>60×60 cm</strong>, or custom sizes, they ensure your rug turns out exactly as envisioned.<br /><br />
      We also offer expert color matching services, allowing us to perfectly replicate shades from swatches, yarn samples, tufts, or fabric references you provide. Every hue is matched with precision to bring your creative vision to life.<br />
      We value our clients and partners — that’s why we provide special discounts or even free strike-offs for regular clients, depending on sample value.<br /><br />
      ✨ From concept to craftsmanship, every detail is woven to perfection.
