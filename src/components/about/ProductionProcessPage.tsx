      "Raw wool is carefully sorted, impurities removed, and thoroughly cleaned.",
    detailedDescription:
      "We begin with pure Tibetan wool sourced from the High Himalayas of Nepal, known for its strength, softness, and natural sheen. Each fleece is hand-sorted to remove impurities and separate natural color shades. The wool is then washed in warm water, cleansing away oils and dust — preparing it to absorb dyes beautifully and evenly.We use 100% Tibetan wool, never mixed, ensuring the finest quality from the very first touch."

    description:
      "Fibers are combed to remove residues and prepare for spinning.",
    detailedDescription:
      "The cleaned wool is hand-carded using traditional wooden and steel combs. This process aligns the fibers, removes the last traces of impurities, and creates a smooth, airy texture — the perfect foundation for spinning fine yarns."

    title: "Spinning",
    image: "assets/images/about/3.jpg",
    description:
      "Traditional spinning wheels twist threads into yarn.",
    detailedDescription:
      "Our artisans spin the carded wool on the wooden wheel (Charkha), twisting and drawing each fiber into yarns of perfect thickness. Yarn thickness depends on the rug’s knot density — coarser for 60–80 knots, finer for 100–150 knots. Every spin carries the rhythm of tradition, forming the soul of a timeless hand-knotted rug.",

    title: "Dyeing",

    description:
      "Yarns are dyed with Swiss chrome azo-free or vegetable dyes.",
    detailedDescription:
      "The spun yarns are washed again and then dyed by hand in large metal pots heated over wood or gas stoves. We use Swiss Chrome Azo-free dyes or natural vegetable dyes, depending on the desired color tone. Each hue is tested, matched, and fixed to perfection — ensuring brilliant, long-lasting colors that remain true for generations."

    description:
      "Weavers handcraft rugs using looms and traditional tools.",
    detailedDescription:
      "Weaving is where craftsmanship meets art. Each rug is woven on vertical looms by master weavers following 1:1 scale design graphs placed in front of them. Using simple tools — scissors, rods, wooden beaters, and hammers — they tie each knot with precision and care. Thousands of hand-tied knots unite to form intricate patterns, capturing the essence of artistry."

    title: "Clipping & Carving",

    description:
      "Edges are clipped and designs refined for a smooth finish.",
    detailedDescription:
      "Once off the loom, the rug undergoes its first transformation. Using large traditional scissors (Khapsi), artisans clip the surface evenly, revealing a smooth, luminous pile. Edges of motifs are hand-carved to enhance definition and create a refined, sculpted texture."

    description:
      "Rugs are washed with soap and left to dry naturally.",
    detailedDescription:
      "The rug is then washed thoroughly using natural soaps like Sapindus and gentle liquid cleansers. Artisans beat the rug with long wooden paddles, ensuring deep cleansing and softness. Finally, it is sun-dried naturally, allowing the Himalayan sunlight to bring warmth and life to every fiber."
  },
  {
    title: "Second Clipping and Carving",
    image: "assets/images/about/8.jpg",
    description: "Surfaces are clipped again for uniformity.",
    detailedDescription:

    image: "assets/images/about/9.jpeg",
    description: "Rugs are stretched on frames to lock their shape.",
    detailedDescription:
      "To maintain shape and symmetry, the rug is stretched on iron frames using hooks on all four sides. It remains in place for at least 7-8 hours, allowing the weave to settle evenly for flawless alignment and structure."
